#### Event Details

 Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

* Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community.

* Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.

* You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

<br>

#### Rules

* To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). 
* The repository you are contributing should have __hacktoberfest__ label.
* PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
* This year, the first 70,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize. 

<br>

#### Quality Standards

In line with Hacktoberfest values **(Quantity is fun, quality is key)** , here you are provided examples of pull requests that we consider to be low-quality contributions (which we discourage).

* Pull requests that are automated (e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace/fix typos/optimize images).

* Pull requests that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request).

* Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.

* Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.

**Last but not least, one pull request to fix multiple typo's is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove 5 stray whitespace is not.**
